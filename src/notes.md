# Notes from MLP regressor runs on Grambow's dataset

- only forward reactions in the test dataset
- both forward and backward reactions in the test dataset
- normalize $\Delta$ H before using it as a feature
- use $\Delta$ H directly without normalization

2 x 2 -> 4 runs

# Notes from Grambow's paper on the dataset

- reactions in the dataset consist of at most seven heavy atoms (C, N, O)
- for a single reactant chosen, a reaction network was grown around it.
- the dataset can be considered to comprise of a handful of reaction networks
